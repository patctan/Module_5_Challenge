# Module_5_Challenge

This web application lets the user make a list of items to finish throughout the day. The input boxes are separated into one-hour time blocks equivalent to standard business hours.

Once the save button is pressed, the text is saved to local storage and will be displayed again, even when the user refreshes the page.

For added convenience, each hour time block is dynamically color coded to give the user a visual indicator of the current time.

Roadmap:

In the future, I would like to change the color of the text to make it more easily readable for users.

Additionally, I would like to change the colors for the "past" and "future" time blocks, since red and green are difficult to distinguish from each other for users who have red-green color blindness.
